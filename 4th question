<!-- 4. Validate the Password
I have an app for my employees in my company, I need my employees password to be safe, so I
want to make a Python App which says if the password is safe or no, the password is given by an
input assigned in a variable called password, it should go into the following points: 1) Minimum
8 characters.
2) The alphabets must be between [a-z]
3) At least one alphabet should be of Upper Case [A-Z]
4) At least 1 number or digit between [0-9].
5) At least 1 symbol like [ _ or @ or $ ]. -->

def validate_password(password):

    if len(password) < 8:
        return False
    
    has_lowercase = False
    has_uppercase = False
    has_digit = False
    has_symbol = False

    for char in password:
        if char.islower():
            has_lowercase = True
        elif char.isupper():
            has_uppercase = True
        elif char.isdigit():
            has_digit = True
        elif char in ['_', '@', '$']:
            has_symbol = True
    
    if has_lowercase and has_uppercase and has_digit and has_symbol:
        return True
    else:
        return False

password = input("Enter password: ")

if validate_password(password):
    print("Password is safe.")
else:
    print("Password is not safe. Password should contains min. 8 characters, one uppercase, one lowercase one digit and one special character.")
